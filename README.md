# FlashGamePlayer
* With the death of Adobe Flash, I have attempted to create a sort of player. Even though I am not entirely sure how this would work for multiple reasons.
  1. Since everyone would be using the same SWF file, will progress be shared or different per user?
  2. As of 3/25/21 (The last time I actually started working on it) It would seem the entire program broke by the flash player control disappearing from my toolbox, and am currently trying to see if there is a way to get it back. If not the program will sadly have to be axed.

## Some Features
* **Modding:** Some games will have a built-in trainer to change some of the values such as damage, health, money, etc.
* **View Your Own SWF File:** If you have an SWF file or know how to get an SWF file and would like to view it you could also use this program as an SWF Viewer.
